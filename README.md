# Details

1. Original implementation uses offical resnet weights, however the resent structure has been modified in the latest pytorch code.(FIXED)
2. Add dataloader scripts to read color images, convert segmentation image to label image(pixel values range from 1-9) and generate classification label.(FIXED)
